This repository aims to provide simple re-usable components to address common UI concerns.

It's based on next.js/react and styled jsx but the aim is not to couple things too tightly, the CSS should be extractable to an external stylesheet and HTML to a rendering method of your choice.

## Components

Proposed componenets:

- Modal

  - Full screen

- Popup

  - Configurable
  - Closable

- Button
  - Text
  - Icon

## Styling
